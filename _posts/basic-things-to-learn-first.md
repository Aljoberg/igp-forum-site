## What are the basic things that I need to learn first to know how to create a discord bot professionally?
### There are some basic things that you'll need to learn first to create your discord bot professionally. Here are the list of things that you'll need to learn first to create your first professional bot. 

 1. https://discordjs/guide This is the offical guide website for the [discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js) package.
 2. https://discord.js.org/#/docs/ This is the offical documentation for discord.js package.
 3. https://google.com/ Google out your issue. Don't paste the entire error into google. Google will not know what is " DiscordAPIError[50006]: Cannot send an empty message
    at SequentialHandler.runRequest (C:\Users\Sussy Amongus\Desktop\Your bot thing\node_modules\@discordjs\rest\dist\index.js:667:15)
    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)       
    at async SequentialHandler.queueRequest (C:\Users\Sussy Amongus\Desktop\Your bot thing\node_modules\@discordjs\rest\dist\index.js:464:14)" 
    Instead just read or copy and paste the first line of the error into google.       
 4. Learn Basic JavaSscript. If you are looking forawrd to make a professional Discord bot you'll need to learn some basic JavaScript. If you want to learn JavaScript or we call it JS for short here are some recommendations course that are free.
             1. Learn what is JavaScript : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHjqpvDnNGE This is a   video that was created by the channel "FireShip" in youtube. 
             2. After learning what is JavaScript start learning about the basic things of JavaScript. There are many courses about the basics of JavaScript. But in my opinion Codedamn JavaScript course is the best. Because It tells you what is JavaScript in a video format. But if you don't like watching videos and want to read paragraphs of text w3chools course is the best for paragraphs.   Here is the link for w3chool JavaScript course. https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp
             3. After learning Basic JavaScript or the entire JavaScript learn Node.js. Here is the video telling you what is Node.js : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVwtVBpw7RQ After knowing what is NodeJS you should learn what is the basics of JavaScript. Here is a playlist about NodeJS basics https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAUi8pPlcUM&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwh8shCMHFA5kWxD9PaPwxaY. 
  5. After you learned all of that stuff you'll have the knowledge to create your own professional bot. Start by reading about [guides for Discord.js](https://discordjs.guide/) stuck on your first error? Try to ask the error in [DiscordJS support server](https://discord.gg/djs), if it is related in DiscordJS or you can ask it out in Imagine Gaming Play discord bot help in the [IGP Coding Villa](https://discord.gg/igp).
